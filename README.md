# Readme

Clone of <http://git.osmocom.org/osmocom-bb>, extended by a virtual-layer-1.

The virtual layer was used in combination with [osmo-mitm](https://github.com/BastusIII/osmo-mitm) for the validation of the Man-in-the-Middle attack developed in my master thesis.

The code from the virtual layer in this repository is no longer maintained her, as it has been adopted in <http://git.osmocom.org/osmocom-bb> by Harald Welte. Thanks.
